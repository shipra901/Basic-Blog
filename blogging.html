            <p class="text">TESS was launched on April 18 from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, 
                and is now ensconced in a looping orbit of the Earth that takes it all the way out to the moon
                 and then back close to Earth to dump its data. It has four cameras that stare at orange slices
                  of the sky from pole to equator for 27 days at a time.

                Among the 73 candidates, the TESS team announced on Wednesday, is a so-called “super-Earth.”
                It circles the sun-like star Pi Mensae at a distance of about 7 million miles every 6.3 days,
                 a distance Dr. Ricker described as “quite a bit too toasty” to be habitable by the likes of us.
                  The same star was already known to harbor a planet some 10 times as massive as Jupiter with a 
                  six-year orbit. That leaves that star with two planets — one too hot and one too cold.</p>
